# Overlook

This is the final, solo project for Front End Module 2 at Turing School of Software & Design. 

In this project, I built a hotel management tool for hotel staff to see customer details, book rooms, and create room service orders. (See the instructor-provided specification [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/overlook.html).)

  * Implement OOP design principles
  * Create a robust test suite

### Tools Used

  * JS, SCSS, HTML
  * Webpack
  * Mocha/Chai
  * Fetch API
  * JQuery/JQuery-UI
